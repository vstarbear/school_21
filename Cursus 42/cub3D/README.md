# cub3d
First-person 3D representation of a maze using raycasting, similar to Wolfenstein 3D (1992).

The project runs using the MiniLibX, a simplified version of the Xlib. It can therefore only run in MacOSX, preferably on a computer with a solid CPU !\

You can also use ``make`` to generate the cub3D executable. You can launch it with ``./cub3D maps/map.cub``

Controls are the same as the project with bonuses, but only ``W A S D`` to move, ``← →`` to turn are available, keys  Up and Down to change eyelevel and ``+ -`` change move speed.

You can run it  ``./cub3D maps/map.cub --save `` to take a screenshot at ``.bmp`` format

You can change ``map.cub`` file.
