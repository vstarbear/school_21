FT_PRINTF
This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. You will then be allowed to reuse the function in your future projects. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.

FT_SERVER
This project is intended to introduce you to the basics of system and network administration. It will allow you to install a complete web server, using a deployment technology named Docker.

GNL - Get Next Line
May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects.

LIBFT 
This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

CUB3D
This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90's game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you'll have to find your way.
