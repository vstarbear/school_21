I'll put all of my work made during the Piscines, a kind of a bootcamp that lasts roughly 4 weeks, working 7 days a week, day and night. These bootcamps cover the basics so there's no need to have any experience at all. People will try and will fail, over and over again. This trial-and-error process is necessary in order to find solutions to problems that once thought impossible. People learn by working by yourself and in groups with other students, without teachers. It can be done, and it works.
